Hello Class!
My name is Ben, and I look forward to learning some computer skills with you all.
I have enjoyed learning some coding skills in the past, but I am looking forward to taking them to the next level. The ability of economics to provide a framework for, and solve problems is one of my driving reasons I study it. The sort of skills I hope to learn in this class will make that whole process much more effective. I want to one day be able to combine economic intuition with skills that can meaningfully make headway into the questions of whichever industry I'm working in. Outside of school, I enjoy writing, reading, and working out.
